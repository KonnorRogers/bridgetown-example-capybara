# Purpose

To provide an example structure of using Capybara with Minitest with
Bridgetown.

## Testing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ParamagicDev/bridgetown-example-capybara
cd bridgetown-example-capybara
bundle install
bundle exec rake test
```

## Notes

Right now there are no assertions, it merely visits the page.

## Issues

Apparition comes with warnings, its still in active development, feel
free to switch to Selenium.
